            Evidence for Change specialises in facilitating theories of change,
            alternate analysis, results frameworks, and tools; building evidence
            through pluralistic methodologies, participatory learning, and
            action; and establishing efficient monitoring, evaluation, and
            learning systems through a multidisciplinary approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            We specialise in designing and conducting research and evaluation in
            multiple domains, with a variety of partners, through a
            collaborative process.
          </p>
          <p>
            We deliver quality impact evaluations through rigorous experimental,
            quasi-experimental, mixed-method, and qualitative methods, both
            nationally and internationally. Our focus areas include conducting
            impact assessments, programme evaluations, summative and performance
            evaluations, action research, exploratory and formative assessments,
            literature reviews, sectoral studies, and organisational
            assessments, amongst others.

          We have carried out over 100 project/programme evaluations and
          organisational assessments, using methods and approaches that help
          communities and programme staff reflect, assess, learn, and apply
          strategies. The team has strong experience in using evidence to
          contribute to shaping public and organisational policies and improving
          programme strategies.

            Recently, the team (CMS and 3ie), working with the Government,
            concluded the evaluation of the National Rural Livelihood Projectâ€™s
            (NRLP) programme working on women's empowerment and decision-making
            within the household through access to credit. We studied the impact
            of the programme and the institutional support that SHG provides to
            women with the aim of providing a sustainable livelihood and
            financial inclusion. We measured the decision-making capacity of
            women based on the responses recorded to 26 questions that covered a
            variety of scenarios within households, such as food, children,
            education, assets, and finance.
