          Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) play a pivotal role in aggregating
          shareholder demand and products. However, the FPCs face significant
          challenges, such as poor quality of produce, unplanned growth of
          producer institutions, limited access to enterprise financing, and
          inadequate support through agencies. These issues have impacted the
          overall reputation of FPCs, making it difficult for them to maintain
          strong buyer relations and ensure higher returns for farmers. As a
          result, the confidence of FPC shareholders in these institutions has
          diminished, leading to reduced engagement. Additionally, smallholder
          farmers often find themselves indebted to traders and are compelled to
          sell their produce at unfavourable margins. Moreover, they employ
          less-than-optimal production techniques, which further impacts their
          cost of production.
