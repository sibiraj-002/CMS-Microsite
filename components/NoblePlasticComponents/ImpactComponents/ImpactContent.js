For the last two months, I have been able to provide my family with three meals a day. I am still in a lot of debt that I am working hard to pay off, but my husband has found some job that will allow us to make little more money for the family. However, unlike the old times, I do not feel helpless and worried about his lack of earnings anymore. I am confident that my hanger unit will support my family with their needs.

Being the line supervisor, I directly manage the immediate workforce. We are all like a family now,” he added. Sanjay joined the Hanger Unit and became one of the first hired labourers in the Fuzhio-run Hanger Sorting Unit in Mohammadpur. According to him, this livelihood opportunity at the Hanger Sorting Unit has come to him as “God’s Blessing” which has saved him from his “ongoing unemployment struggle” of the last two years.

She started out with easier tasks, and now her role has transitioned to checking the quality of the hangers, sorting the hangers and taking inventory, which she finds more difficult.

                                Tucked away in a bustling, close-packed locality of Bommanahalli is the Hanger Sorting Unit set up by Noble Plastic in Bengaluru. This unit has a bunch of 10 enthusiastic individuals working through the day to sort the hangers, package them and send them for recycling. The unit starts functioning at 9 AM in the morning with two tables full of hangers to be sorted for the day and 4 women working at each table to sort them. The rest of the area is filled with stacked cartons filled with hangers that are either left to be sorted or are sorted and packed for recycling.

                                “Amidst all the stacks of cartons sits Srinivas in the corner packing away boxes one after the other. Srinivas is responsible for packing of the hangers after they are sorted and also unpacking the hangers that come in for sorting at the unit. Additionally, Srinivas also works on baling film plastics, which essentially compresses loose plastic, making it easy for recycling. Srinivas has been working at the unit for 3 years now, right since its inception. He lives in the area nearby called the Gulbarga Colony. Migrated to the city a few years back in search of work, Srinivas struggles speaking in Hindi but is keen on learning Hindi and English. Srinivas also runs errands around the unit all day and trains the new employees at the unit, all this while bantering around and lightening the mood at the workplace. “I love to help out others with work here. Working here for so long, this has become like my extended family. It feels amazing to come here everyday and contribute to the team effort.”, says Srinivas.
