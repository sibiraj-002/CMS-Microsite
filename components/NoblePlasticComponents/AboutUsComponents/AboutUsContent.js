                                Piloted in 2018 along with apparel sector in India, our core business is to repurpose and recycle apparel plastics, including used hangers, sizers, plaques and other plastics from corporations in the apparel industry, and ensure that they enter the apparel space again. Our operations are currently spread out across two major sites in Indiaâ€”Delhi and Bengaluru

                                The repurposing of hangers is undertaken mainly by women and members of marginalised communities, who are hired, trained and empowered to work by our organisation. Recycling of hangers and other plastics is handled by our partner recycling organisations, which ensures that the plastics we work with are handled safely throughout the process.

                                Noble Plastics also works with partners to convert non-recyclable plastics into oil via pyrolysis. We aim to pyrolyse 1,000 tonnes of plastics and channel them into more productive uses over the next 2 years.
