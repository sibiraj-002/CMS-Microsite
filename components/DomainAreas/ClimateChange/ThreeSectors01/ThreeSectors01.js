          Agricultural systems are on the front lines of climate change, both
          creating and affected by it, contributing significantly to water usage
          and livestock carbon emissions. With increased weather variability,
          shifting growing seasons, and changing precipitation patterns, small
          and marginal farmers are disproportionately affected. They are the
          backbone of a country’s agriculture, and climate change endangers both
          food security and livelihoods.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-[#404040]">
          <span className="text-cms-primary-green">Our Approach: </span> We work
          closely with small and marginal farmers to adopt climate-smart
          agricultural practices and sustainable farming techniques. We also
          support the creation of resilient food supply chains and value-added
          processes to reduce post-harvest losses. The practices that are
          promoted are planned in such a way that there is biodiversity
          conservation and resource regeneration.

          For example, our work through the GREEN Foundation, which works at the
          intersection of food, energy, and health systems using regenerative
          models that integrate agricultural practices, sustainable land use,
          and rural communities, focuses on promoting regenerative agriculture
          practices by small-holder farmers through a combination of inputs,
          practices, financing, and market demand.

          Our work through Vrutti which has a strong grassroots presence and
          works closely in the livelihoods sector, enhancing people’s well-being
          through knowledge, innovations and transformative actions. Mobilising
          and institutionalising (institutions and clusters) small producers in
          order to build their collective agency and supply chain
          sustainability. Vrutti strongly believes that ‘Sustainable Livelihood
          Approaches’ can be a great lever to address poverty, marginalisation
          and inclusive development.
