            Challenges: Climate change has a profound impact on people’s
            well-being, as evidenced by the strain on our health system caused
            by the rising prevalence of illnesses (waterborne, vector-borne, and
            foodborne diseases) related to climate change (heat waves, storms,
            and floods). At the same time, people’s unsustainable behaviours,
            like high carbon emissions and deforestation, exacerbate the
            challenges faced by health systems worldwide.

            Our Approach: We focus on developing circular health solutions that
            enhance the resilience of health ecosystems. This includes scaling
            solutions that reduce carbon, building resilience and readying
            communities for climate impact, and strengthening systems to cope
            with climate-led health emergencies. Our goal is to ensure access to
            quality healthcare services even in the face of climate-related
            disruptions.

              Our work is through the Green Health Alliance (GHA), which
              addresses the health facilities becoming net zero (energy, water,
              and plastic focus), readying the populations to mitigate and adapt
              to climate change health issues (through local plans and
              preparations), and reading the health facilities to cope when
              there is a surge of demand due to climate emergencies.

              Our work through Swasti, as the ‘health catalyst’ of the group,
              focuses on people-centric health and well-being, with vulnerable
              communities as key participants. Swasti champions the ‘One Health’
              approach, which recognises that the health of people is
              interconnected with people, animals, plants, and our environment.
              The effects of climate change and human health are deeply
              intertwined, with Swasti working intricately at the intersection.

              Comprehensive Integrated Health and Climate Change Response
              (CIHCR) Playbook Recognising the profound link between climate
              change and public health and requiring a collaborative response to
              interconnected issues, the CPHC Alliance (co-incubated by the
              Catalyst Group) co-authored the playbook, drawing from
              multi-sectoral expertise, learnings from the lived realities of
              communities at the last mile, and experience. The Playbook is the
              first of its kind in India and offers a practical approach to
              district stakeholders, policymakers, investors, and implementers
              to ensure that communities, particularly vulnerable, are able to
              enjoy good health and well-being and are protected and ready for
              the fallouts of drastic climate change.

              Through the playbook, a systems approach is offered to integrate:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Fragmented health system and response <br /> 2. Disaster and
              climate preparedness <br /> 3. Multiple key stakeholder responses
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It also includes critical insight, useful frameworks, interesting
              examples from across the length and breadth of our nation and
              beyond, and working methods that span a range of topics, including
              governance, financing, technology, and more, leading to an
              easy-to-deploy ready-to-implement integrated district climate and
              health response.

              Overall, our work in these target sectors is driven by a
              commitment to building resilience, reducing carbon emissions, and
              creating sustainable pathways for vulnerable communities. Through
              a combination of innovative solutions, technical support, and
              partnerships, we aim to make a substantial positive impact in
              these critical areas while advancing our vision of a thriving
              world powered by resilient communities and carbon-neutral systems.
