            Challenges: Industries and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises
            (MSMEs) are significant contributors to carbon emissions. It is
            vital to help them transition to more sustainable and low-carbon
            operations. While large companies are increasingly committed to and
            able to move in a net-zero direction, it is the MSMEs who will need
            support in the transition.

            moving towards Net Zero emissions.

              Noble Plastics is an eco-social initiative that champions the
              effective use of apparel plastic waste while promoting the
              well-being of people and the planet. Commenced in 2018 along with
              apparel giants M&S India, the core business of Noble Plastics was
              to repurpose and recycle apparel plastics, including used hangers
              from 100+ stores in India, and sell them back to fashion
              companies.

              Driving the Processing of Non-Recyclable, Dead End Plastics
              through Advanced Pyrolysis in partnership with APChemi—a process
              that converts non-recyclable, problem plastics from coastal cities
              into high-grade circular fuel that serves as a feedstock for
              petrochemicals and other entities to generate circular chemicals
              and hydrogen, among other products.

              Our collaborative study with the University of Greenwich focused
              on “Reducing Ocean Plastics: Formative Research Leading to
              Intervention Planning in India." This research was aimed at
              advancing the current understanding of land-based and other
              sources of plastics entering Indian oceans, government and private
              sector responses, existing policies and programmes to address
              plastic waste in India, and potential solutions that can address
              the problem on the scale required, as well as ideas for the
              planning of specific interventions in specific hotspots.

              The Catalyst Group also co-developed an article with Vihara on
              “PANDEMIC PLASTICS: The Upsurge of Single-Use Plastics During the
              COVID-19 Pandemic," which critically assessed the COVID plastic
              PPE crisis and charted out ways to effectively upcycle biomedical
              plastic waste for hospitals. Its publication is pending.
